# Overview
This data analysis project focuses on exploring a dataset of airline passenger reviews to gain insights into various aspects of the airline experience. The dataset contains valuable information such as overall ratings, traveler types, seat types, in-flight experiences, and more. By applying SQL queries, we aim to uncover patterns, relationships, and trends within the data.

# Objectives
Understand how different factors impact overall ratings.
Analyze the influence of traveler types and seat types on satisfaction levels.
Identify patterns in the ratings for specific in-flight experiences (e.g., seat comfort, cabin staff service, food and beverages).
Investigate correlations between aspects of the in-flight experience (e.g., ground service, Wi-Fi/connectivity) and overall ratings.
Assess the influence of reviews mentioning "value for money" on overall ratings.
Examine the impact of reviews mentioning certain locations on overall ratings.
Data Analysis
We employed SQL queries to conduct the following analyses:

Traveler Types and Seat Types: Explored whether business travelers tend to give higher ratings than leisure travelers and whether seat types affect overall ratings.

In-Flight Experiences: Analyzed different aspects of the in-flight experience (e.g., seat comfort, cabin staff service, food and beverages) to understand their relationship with overall ratings.

Ground Service and Wi-Fi/Connectivity: Investigated how ground service and Wi-Fi/connectivity ratings influence overall ratings.

"Value for Money" Mentions: Assessed whether reviews mentioning "value for money" correlate with higher or lower overall ratings.

Locations Mentioned in Reviews: Explored the impact of reviews mentioning specific locations on overall ratings.

# Findings
Through this analysis, we identified various insights, including the following:

Specific in-flight experiences may have a significant impact on overall ratings.
Business travelers tend to have different rating patterns compared to leisure travelers.
Reviews mentioning "value for money" may correlate with higher or lower overall ratings.
The influence of location mentions on overall ratings varies.
Conclusion
This project provides a comprehensive analysis of airline passenger reviews, offering valuable insights into factors affecting overall ratings. The findings can be used to inform decisions related to improving the airline experience, resource allocation, and customer satisfaction.

The SQL queries and results presented here serve as a foundation for further analysis and decision-making, making this project a valuable addition to a data analysis portfolio.
